🛡️ AI Social Engineering Fraud Detection System: Monolith DocumentationA real-time, three-stage financial fraud detection system combining communication analysis (NLP) and transaction anomaly detection to combat sophisticated social engineering attacks.This document details the system's capabilities, architecture, deployment, and API specification.1. 🚀 System Capabilities (~@ System Capabilities)The core of the system is a three-stage machine learning pipeline that produces a comprehensive Fused Risk Score for any transaction event linked to a communication channel.1.1. Communication Risk Analysis (M-9 1)Purpose: Identifies language patterns associated with fraud, coercion, and phishing attempts.Model: Logistic Regression (LR).Extracted Features: Sentiment polarity, Urgency keywords, Manipulative language indicators.Output: $P(\text{Comm Risk})$ (Communication Risk Score).1.2. Transaction Behavioral Risk (M-9 2)Purpose: Detects deviations from established user financial habits and transactional anomalies.Model: XGBoost (loaded from JSON).Analyzed Patterns: High/abnormal amount, Geo-location mismatch, New device behavior, Frequency spikes, Time-interval anomalies.
